## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

- 1. Create HTML
- 2. Create JS functions > error validation
- 3. Style Mobile > Desktop


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind Css
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- Learned more about JS and Error Validations
- refreshed knowledge with js/css error styling

### Continued development

There's probably minor issues with this project so I would not be continuing this one and move on to the next junior/intermediate challenges
